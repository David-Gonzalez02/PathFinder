# PathFinder
Java pathfinding Application
This project is my first real application created in java, and was inspired by the countless different pathfinders populating the internet. This pathfinder provides
a grid that the user may manipulate through the use of obstacles. Once the user has generated the obstacles, they can then place a start and finish point on the map
for the pathfinder to find a path between. There are two algorithms that may be used to find the path, and one a path is found or there is deemed no path, the program can
be reset.
